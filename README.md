# mcuCollection
Collection of some mcu projects, arduino compatible

Pin pad was working in a door for more than two and half years without problems.

BPM meter had some problems, as the MCU used (Photon) had at the time of making a lag in the loop due to wifi functionality. This caused the sampling to be poor, and the gap in between. Also the chosen microphone from eBay was not the greatest of quality and did not give very accurate readings. This said it still works for over a year in a club house where music is being played. It is connected to an IRC bot which, can call up the temperature, humidity and noise-level of the room.

Libraries need to be downloaded.
